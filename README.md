Mining-Massive-Datasets
=======================

This is my repository for Stanford's [Mining Massive Datasets](https://class.coursera.org/mmds-001) MOOC on Coursera.  

The implementations for the solutions are in R.  Please feel free to refer to this repository should you need help with the Assignments (they're hard!).  Nonetheless, do try to solve the questions on your own first (the discussion forums are really helpful!).  

Please star this repository if you found it helpful!
